Verse 1:
Listen up y'all, I got something to say
About version control systems, they're here to stay
Whether Git, SVN or Mercurial
These tools are essential, make no denial

Verse 2:
Version control's about tracking your code
Storing versions like a digital abode
So when changes are made, you can always know
What was done, when and by who, just like a pro

Verse 3:
Collaboration's a breeze with VCS in hand
Multiple developers can work on the same strand
Without worrying about code conflicts or merge
VCS got your back, like a trusted sergeant

Verse 4:
With branching and merging, you can experiment
With new features and changes, with no detriment
Create a new branch, work on it with zest
Merge it back in, when it passes your test

Verse 5:
Say goodbye to the days of manual backups
Version control systems keep your code on trackups
In the event of data loss, no need to worry
Restore a previous version, it's easy as cherry

Verse 6:
So whether you're working solo or with a team
Version control is a must, it's not a dream
Choose the right VCS, learn it like a pro
And watch your code soar, like a perfect throw.
